# holstein
A quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the Hubbard-Holstein model.

## Publication
This program was used to produce the SSE data in

J. Greitemann, S. Hesselmann, S. Wessel, F. F. Assaad, and M. Hohenadler: *Finite-size effects in Luther-Emery phases of Holstein and Hubbard models*. [Phys. Rev. B **92**, 245132](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.92.245132), 2015.

The algorithm is described in detail in J. Greitemann's Master Thesis. Contact him for a digital copy.

## Running the program
The program depends on a Monte Carlo library which is not publicly avaiable. Thus, the code will not compile as-is. The API used in the code should be rather self-explanatory and allow porting to your favorite Monte Carlo library.
